# GitHub Actions & GitLab CI/CD - Complete DevOps Interview & Study Guide

This guide covers everything you need to confidently answer **GitHub Actions**, **GitLab**, and **GitLab CI/CD** interview questions ‚Äî from basic concepts to advanced automation pipelines with real-world examples.

---

## üß† 1. What is GitHub Actions?

**Answer:**
GitHub Actions is a **CI/CD platform** built into GitHub that allows you to **automate your build, test, and deployment workflows** directly from your repository.

**Key Features:**
- Built into GitHub ‚Äî no separate setup needed.  
- Supports **YAML-based workflow definitions**.  
- Triggers on **GitHub events** (push, pull_request, issue, etc.).  
- Runs jobs inside **Docker containers or VMs**.  
- Supports **matrix builds** and **self-hosted runners**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. GitHub Actions Architecture

**Components:**
- **Workflow:** The complete automation process (defined in `.github/workflows/*.yml`).
- **Job:** A group of steps executed on the same runner.
- **Step:** Individual task in a job (run commands or actions).
- **Action:** Reusable commands packaged as YAML or Docker containers.
- **Runner:** Machine that executes the workflow.

## üß© 3. Example GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Deploy
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        run: echo "Deploying to production..."
```

## üß∞ 4. Common GitHub Actions Commands

| Task | Command / Description |
|------|------------------------|
| Define workflow file | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |
| Manually trigger | `workflow_dispatch` |
| Trigger on push | `on: push` |
| Use predefined action | `uses: actions/checkout@v3` |
| Run shell command | `run: echo Hello World` |
| Access secrets | `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}` |
| Conditional step | `if: github.event_name == 'push'` |

---

## üîë 5. Managing Secrets in GitHub Actions

**Steps:**
1. Go to repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets ‚Üí Actions.  
2. Add a new secret (e.g., `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`).  
3. Use it in workflow:
   ```yaml
   env:
     AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY }}
   ```

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è 6. GitHub Actions with Docker & AWS

**Build and Push Docker Image:**
```yaml
name: Build and Push Docker Image
on: [push]

jobs:
  docker:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Build Docker image
        run: docker build -t myapp:${{ github.sha }} .
      - name: Push to Docker Hub
        run: |
          echo "${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}" | docker login -u "${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}" --password-stdin
          docker push myapp:${{ github.sha }}
```

---

## üß™ 7. Advanced Concepts

**Matrix Builds:**
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    node: [14, 16, 18]
steps:
  - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
    with:
      node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
```

**Reusable Workflows:**
```yaml
jobs:
  call-reusable:
    uses: user/repo/.github/workflows/deploy.yml@main
```

**Self-hosted Runner:**
- Configure your own machine as a runner:
  ```bash
  ./config.sh --url https://github.com/your/repo --token <token>
  ./run.sh
  ```

## üöÄ 8. GitHub Actions Interview Questions

**Q1: What are GitHub Actions used for?**  
A: To automate CI/CD workflows, testing, and deployments within GitHub.

**Q2: What is the syntax format of a workflow file?**  
A: YAML (`.yml`) under `.github/workflows/` directory.

**Q3: How can we trigger a GitHub Action manually?**  
A: Use `workflow_dispatch` event.

**Q4: Can we have multiple workflows in one repository?**  
A: Yes, each workflow file can be defined separately under `.github/workflows/`.

**Q5: What are GitHub-hosted vs. self-hosted runners?**  
A: GitHub-hosted are managed by GitHub; self-hosted are user-managed.

**Q6: How do you pass data between jobs?**  
A: Use `outputs` and `needs` keywords.

**Q7: How do you integrate GitHub Actions with AWS?**  
A: Configure AWS credentials using `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials`.
